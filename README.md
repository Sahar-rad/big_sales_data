This repository provides a comprehensive framework for a regression task for the BigMart Sales dataset
The dataset contains valuable information about the sales of various products in different retail outlets. The dataset contains the following key features:

Item_Identifier: A unique identifier for each product, allowing us to distinguish between different items.

Item_Weight: The weight of each product, which can be useful for understanding its physical characteristics.

Item_Fat_Content: Indicates whether the product is labeled as low fat or not, providing insights into dietary preferences.

Item_Visibility: Represents the percentage of total display area in a store allocated to a specific product, influencing its visibility to customers.

Item_Type: Categorizes each product into a specific type, helping to analyze sales patterns for different product categories.

Item_MRP: Refers to the Maximum Retail Price (list price) of each product, aiding in pricing and revenue analysis.

Outlet_Identifier: A unique identifier for each store, enabling us to distinguish between different outlets.

Outlet_Establishment_Year: Indicates the year in which each store was established, which might influence sales trends and store performance.

Outlet_Size: Describes the size of each store in terms of ground area covered, which can impact its capacity and product availability.

Outlet_Location_Type: Categorizes the type of city in which each store is located, providing insights into regional sales patterns.

Outlet_Type: Specifies whether each outlet is a grocery store or a supermarket, helping to distinguish between different types of stores.

Item_Outlet_Sales: This is the outcome variable to be predicted in the dataset, representing the sales of each product in a particular store. It serves as the target for predictive analysis and regression modeling.

We can conduct various analyses using this dataset and its comprehensive features, such as sales forecasting, product performance evaluation, and store segmentation, in order to gain valuable insight and make data-driven decisions in the retail industry
